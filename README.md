The "IEEE BigData 2021 Cup - Predicting Victories in Video Games" is a data mining competition in which participants submitted solutions to predict victories in the video game Tactical Troops: Anthracite Shift. As none of the bestperforming teams have considered the influence of previous game states in predicting the winner, this paper proposes an approach that uses a sequential dataset generated from game logs to feed into deep neural networks to predict victories. Among the six different deep neural networks implemented, a simplified Fully Convolutional Network model achieved the best performance with an Area Under the Curve score of 0.8447. Although our model did not surpass the performance of the best challenge models, our proposed approach has two significant advantages: the limited need for feature engineering and greater adaptability to other video games.
